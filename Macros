-- Macros are generic logic that can be reused
-- package, on the other hand, lets us import the macro developed by other developers for our project

-- Create a test macro to add 3 for the field
{% macro add_Three(column_nm) %}
{{column_nm}} + 3
{% endmacro %}

-- Execute this macro
select order_dt, {{ add_Three('order_dt') }} as shipment_dt, {{ add_Three('order_id') }} as testID
from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
